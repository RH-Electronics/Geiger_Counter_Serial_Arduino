Here is a list of Operational Check radiation sources and GM tubes I
have tested.

My current preferred "point source" is an inexpensive standalone Fire
Alarm ionization chamber from from http://www.ebay.com/itm/112433372640
used as received.  Do not remove the aluminum cover.

These devices each contain about 1 uCi (micro Curie) of Americium.
Americium is a strong alpha emitter to run the alarm's ionization
chamber, but alpha particles cannot pass thru the aluminum housing.
Fortunately Americium decay also emits some Beta radiation, enough in
fact to average about 150 CPM (+|- 5%) using a Beta/Gamma GM tube such
as the Russian STS-5.

Note that different GM tubes have different sensitivities, to different
types of radiation.  Cross-calibration of different GM tubes is not
possible.

Other inexpensive OpCheck sources include:

- Thoriated (2%) TIG welding rods (end is painted RED), available
at welding supply shops, $35 for a pack of 10, but usually much more
expensive in single quantity.  Other types of TIG Rods that are painted
other colors are NOT radioactive.  Average about 600 CPM with an STS-5
GM tube.

- Vintage Thoriated gas lamp mantles, generally not available in stores,
but some folks sell them on ebay for $15 and up.  Average about 4000
CPM with an STS-5 GM tube.

Note that these are not "point sources" and will result in different
CPM averages depending on the length/area measured (sample size & GM
tube used).
