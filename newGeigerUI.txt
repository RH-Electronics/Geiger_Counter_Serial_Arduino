New Geiger User Interface Documentation

/BriefCase $Revision: 1.7.2.6 $  $Name: RHelec-01_dmk $

by Dave Knight

newGeiger offers two UIs, one via the serial port and the other via the
LCD Shield push buttons:

1 - Serial UI - on startup, a usage message is displayed to the serial port
(9600 baud, N81):

Usage: command [arg1]
 Commands:
  h,? - help
  show - settings
  reset - set defaults
  calFactor [v]
   where: v = factor
  When v omitted, set default
  SAVE - to EEPROM
  d - dbug on/off
  p - plot on/off

This message will appear whenever you start the Arduino IDE Serial
monitor because that resets/reboots the Arduino.

Changes are effective immediately, but are not permanent, unless SAVEd
to EEPROM.  Whenever the Arduino is restarted, calFactor will be set to
the values last saved to EEPROM.  On startup, dbug is OFF and plot is ON.

The default settings (as opposed to the values saved in EEPROM) are:

   calFactor  1.0

See the newGeiger.ino source for details on using calFactor.  It is NOT
intended to cross-calibrate different GM tubes!

The dbug setting controls dbug output for developers. When set to 1,
enhanced debugging info is presented to both the serial port.  When the
lcd UI is active, the top lcd line displays push-button hits.  In
production releases, dbug output is minimal.

The plot setting controls plot data output to the serial port, to drive
the Arduino IDE Serial Plotter feature. As of Rel-0_4, the instantaneous
CPM and the 60 second average CPM are plotted.  To arrive at an accurate
average CPM for any specific sample or environment, readings must be
taken for a full minute.

2 - LCD Push Button UI

Activate the LCD push button UI by pressing SELECT on the LCD Shield.
The normal CPM display is replaced by:

   Configuration UI
   Show Settings

where "Show Settings" is the 1st menu item and is analogous to the "show"
command in the serial UI.

Press SELECT to show the current settings, or press UP or DOWN to scroll
thru the menus:

   Show Settings
   Set Defaults
   Set calFactor
   SAVE settings
   Done, EXIT UI
   Toggle dbug
   Toggle plot

EXIT the lcd UI at any time by pressing the LEFT button.

On exiting the lcd UI, the normal display:

  cpm <number>/ <average>
  mR/h: <number>  <mSv/h>

is restored.

Note that the serial UI, lcd UI and normal counting tasks run
concurrently.
